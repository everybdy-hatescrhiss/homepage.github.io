     <h1>Client-side and server-side engineering</h1>
            
Client side and server side are web development terms that describe where application code runs. Web developers will also refer to this distinction as the frontend vs. the backend, although client-side/server-side and frontend/backend aren't quite the same. In a serverless architecture, the serverless vendor hosts and assigns resources to all server-side processes, and the processes scale up as application usage increases.
What does client side mean?
In web development, 'client side' refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser.
Markup languages like HTML and CSS are interpreted by the browser on the client side. In addition, many contemporary developers are including client-side processes in their application architecture and moving away from doing everything on the server side; business logic for dynamic webpages*, for instance, usually runs client side in a modern web application. Client-side processes are almost always written in JavaScript.
What does server side mean?
Much like with client side, 'server side' means everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server side, and this included rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.
The problem with hosting all of these processes on the server side is that each request involving one of them has to travel all the way from the client to the server, every time. This introduces a great deal of latency. For this reason, contemporary applications run more code on the client side; one use case is rendering dynamic webpages in real time by running scripts within the browser that make changes to the content a user sees.
Like with 'frontend' and 'client-side,' backend is also a term for the processes that take place on the server, although backend only refers to the types of processes and server-side refers to the location where processes run.
