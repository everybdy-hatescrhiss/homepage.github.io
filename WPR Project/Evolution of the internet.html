           <h3> web 1.0</h3> web 1.0
            When the internet was first launched, websites were created specifically to provide information to users. As a result, the only information you could find on the internet was information that a web developer or content developer had specifically placed there.
            Web pages from that era were static pages with all the information programmed directly onto the web page. As a result, these web pages stayed the same way until a web developer changed the web page’s code. Web pages from that era were also not interactive, so once a user landed on a web page, the only thing they could do was read the information and look at the pictures.
            The figure below shows an example of a Web 1.0 web page.

            <h3>WEB 2.0</h3>
            Once sites like Google, MySpace and later YouTube, Twitter and Facebook started appearing, the internet had changed. Websites became interactive and dynamic. Instead of simply providing information, websites became applications that allowed users to search, send messages, post updates and watch videos.
            With Web 2.0, users play a role in the development of content, whether through posting a status update on Facebook, uploading a video on YouTube, or writing an article for Wikipedia. Using this model, Wikipedia has become the world’s largest encyclopaedia with articles on 6 million different topics in more than 100 languages. Every month, 120 000 Wikipedia visitors from around the world update existing articles or write new articles.
             Figure 11.3: Wikipedia is an example of a Web 2.0 website
            With Web 2.0, web developers have a different role. Rather than creating all the content, web developers are responsible for creating a platform (or application) that users can interact with. Users can then create and upload their own content.
           <h3 >WEB 3.0</h3>
            Web 3.0 is like Web 2.0, but smarter! In the last 15 years, the internet has grown (and continues to grow) faster than anyone expected. While more information is usually a good thing, it also means that good or relevant information becomes more and more difficult to find. To solve this problem, internet services are creating increasingly smarter web applications to help find and recommend relevant information to visitors.
            Web 3.0 will be able to get the context from the user; and then be able to provide the user with the most useful information. Web 3.0 can be likened to an artificial intelligence assistant that understands its user and personalizes everything.
            For example, if someone is preparing for a vacation and needs to search for cheap flights and accommodations, they have to look through a lot of information on the web and compare different options and the search might take hours. Web 3.0 search engines or assistants will be able to gather all of this information and present it to the user in a very intelligent way and even make highly accurate and favorable suggestions.
            INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) (CHARACTERISTICS AND USES)
            The Internet of Things is the network of physical devices that are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity, which enables these devices to connect and exchange data. This creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems. IoT results in efficiency 
            Examples include:
            1.	Connected security system where you are able to turn on and off the lights in your house through a smartphone app. You can also open your electronic gate and watch video cameras placed around your property.
            2.	Household appliances, can be operated, for example, by using an app on your smartphone. Here are some examples.
